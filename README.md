## 1. Introduction
This report will illustrate a chat application that works using the command line,
it consists of the integration of four files Chat, Client, Server and SerialServer,
and we used C language to program this application.

## 2. Application features
The application after improvement can provide the following features:
• The server connects between more than two clients.
• The server port number can be changed even after the application is compiled.
• The server saves the private and broadcast messages sent between clients
in record logs and these can be viewed even after closing the session and
reopening it again with a new connection.
• The server shows how many are connected in real time with the name
of the connection, where the number of connections will increase for new
connections and decrease for any closed connection.
• The server will show a notification that a new connection joined with the
name also a notification for a closed connection with the name.
• The application provides the ability to send private messages between two
connections without broadcasting the message to all connections.
